    <p style="text-align: justify;"></p><strong>The Honda Cars</strong> (Japanese:, Hepburn: Honda Shiti) is a subcompact car which has been produced by the
        Japanese manufacturer Honda since 1981.<br>

        The City was originally a 3-door hatchback/2-door convertible for the Japanese, European and Australasian
        markets. The 3-door City was retired in 1994 after the second-generation and replaced by the Logo. The nameplate
        was revived in 1996 for use on a series of subcompact four-door sedans aimed primarily at developing markets,
        first mainly sold in Asia but later also in Latin America and Australia. Since then, it has been a subcompact
        sedan built on Honda's Global Small Car platform, which is shared with the Fit/Jazz (a 5-door hatchback), the
        Airwave/Partner, and the first-generation Mobilio — all of which share the location of the fuel tank under the
        front seats rather than rear seats. The seventh-generation model launched in 2019 features a significant size
        growth, offering an exterior dimension on par with the ninth-generation Civic sedan. This generation also marks
        the introduction of the 5-door hatchback model starting from 2020.<br><br>

        From 2002 to 2008, the City was also sold as the Honda Fit Aria (Japanese: ホンダ・フィット アリア, Hepburn: Honda Fitto
        Aria) in Japan. The City is also sold as the Honda Ballade in South Africa since 2011. The City was reintroduced
        in Japan in 2014, this time called the Honda Grace (Japanese: ホンダ・グレイス, Hepburn: Honda Gureisu) up to its
        discontinuation in 2020. Between 2015 and 2019, Dongfeng Honda sold a remodeled version of the City called the
        Honda Greiz, and its 5-door liftback counterpart Honda Gienia.</p>
